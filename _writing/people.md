Anything great in this world will be used (and loved) by other people. People are motivating, and solving their needs can be a deep motivation to build.

If a product truly helps people, they’ll give you money to use it.

How can you surround with yourself with people that energize your 24/7?

Also - people crave purpose and placement. You can give that to them. Lay the vision out and they’re willing to assist/build in it as well.
