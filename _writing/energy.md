Work feels like the search for more energy. By expending energy today, I aim to give myself more energy in the future.

Where energy can be measured by social access (fame/power) or financial ($$$) or personal (content)

What can you do to bring forward the things that energize most: For me meeting with smart people and bringing magic and joy into the world. Thatâ€™s why tech is amazing. It meets both criteria.

Monitoring your energy levels, after friends, after work, after food, after exercise etc. to learn how to balance.

But. I spend most of my time in schlep work. How can I pull forward the things that energize me most? Deliberate focus
