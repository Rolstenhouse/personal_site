# Summary

**The site has been redone since I worked on it**

Upon joining this organization, I was looking to do some sort of embedded systems programming; however, all of their chips were much more efficient on a cost basis if they just bought them from the store. For this reason, I switched to working on their website; which for some unknown reason had become decimated.

I worked on the `WordPress` website in order to upload all the images that went missing; as well as to make it responsive again. I worked with another developer on the project for several long nights in a row in order to get the website in an acceptable and functional position i.e. before it had the error. 

We had decided to just rebuild it, because they had no backups of their website anywhere. As soon as we got the website into a working order, I decided to move on to other organizations as I was not interested at the time in Gator Motorsports.
