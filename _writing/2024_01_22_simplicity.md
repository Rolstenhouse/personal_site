I learned recently that Charlie Munger used simple models of the world to explain phenomena: critical mass, normal distribution, redundancy. 

Our world is simple at its core, and simple ideas proliferate because most people understand it. Great stories and great companies are built around simple communication. 

A clear idea, communicated in five words. Is instantly more inviting than an essay (though a complex essay is often required to communicate a simple idea in many different ways) 

When starting a company, I've been prone to complex ideas. Hiding behind them because doing simple well, is actually harder. More competition is present, but shouldn't be feared. 

Aim for simplicity.
