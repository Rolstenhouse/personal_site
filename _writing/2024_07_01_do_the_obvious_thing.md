Great businesses, great initiatives, they’re simple to understand.

A simple idea is often the best one and makes it easier for others

Complex ideas or nonobvious insights can feel like intellectual masturbation. No one can touch a complex idea when you’re in your ivory tower.

Have you done the obvious? Struggling with customers -> Pick up the phone and call. Prospect not responding -> Send them donuts. MVP taking too long -> cut scope.

Be on the left.
