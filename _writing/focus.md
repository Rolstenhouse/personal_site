Great things take time and focus. Nothing great starts out unfocused. It needs to be all-consuming because that is when the universe will open doors for you (and you will take advantage of the opportunities presented)

You can’t hide. You can’t procrastinate. There is a goal and you accomplish it, moving mountains to get there.

Have a higher bar than you think for projects. Say “no” to most things, say “hell yes” to what’s truly motivating.

Personal note
I’ve found deep focus for months on end when I feel the clock racing towards a deadline for something amazing.

Every day my clock is ticking and time is running out. What took 1 year in my early 20’s may take closer to 3 years now. Energy is finite, though the ability to focus is better. Lean into it

What’s your number 1 goal today?
