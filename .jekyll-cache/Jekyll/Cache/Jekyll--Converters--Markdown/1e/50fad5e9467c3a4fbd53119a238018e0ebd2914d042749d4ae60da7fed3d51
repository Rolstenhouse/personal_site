<p><strong>The site has been redone since I worked on it</strong></p>

<p>Upon joining this organization, I was looking to do some sort of embedded systems programming; however, all of their chips were much more efficient on a cost basis if they just bought them from the store. For this reason, I switched to working on their website; which for some unknown reason had become decimated.</p>

<p>I worked on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WordPress</code> website in order to upload all the images that went missing; as well as to make it responsive again. I worked with another developer on the project for several long nights in a row in order to get the website in an acceptable and functional position i.e. before it had the error.</p>

<p>We had decided to just rebuild it, because they had no backups of their website anywhere. As soon as we got the website into a working order, I decided to move on to other organizations as I was not interested at the time in Gator Motorsports.</p>
