<p>Built at hackFSU, this “bot” would send random facts to a friend or enemy at a specified phone number. At the time, the project would only send emails from your browser session, rather than forking a separate process on the backEnd. This was done in order to prevent spamming,</p>

<h3 id="during-this-project-i-used">During this project I Used</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PHP</code> to iterate over a list of Useless Facts that was stored as a variable within the program. In order to send to most text message providers within the US, I sent text messages to the specified number using the following format.</p>

<h5 id="email-addresses">Email Addresses</h5>

<pre><code class="language-PHP">$emails = array($phone . '@txt.att.net',
	$phone . '@tmomail.net',
	$phone . '@vtext.com',
	$phone . '@messaging.sprintpcs.com', $phone . '@pm.sprint.com',
	$phone . '@vmobl.com',
	$phone . '@mmst5.tracfone.com',
	$phone . '@mymetropcs.com',
	$phone . '@myboostmobile.com',
	$phone . '@sms.mycricket.com',
	$phone . '@messaging.nextel.com',
	$phone . '@message.alltel.com',
	$phone . '@ptel.com',
	$phone . '@tms.suncom.com',
	$phone . '@qwestmp.com',
	$phone . '@email.uscc.net',
	);
</code></pre>

<p>The drawback to using this approach is two-fold. One, your mail-server may start to look like spam and two, each incoming text comes from a slightly different phone number. This could be seen as an advantage or disadvantage, dependent upon whether the user wanted to assign the incoming texts under a contact.</p>

<p>For the frontEnd, a mobile-first approach was in place by using the <a href="http://materializecss.com/">MaterializeCSS</a> library.</p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>This project is no longer functional, but could be spun up if a cause arises. I.e., simple notification system Twilio alternative during an event.</p>
