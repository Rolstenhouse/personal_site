The internet is easier when you view it as an improv act - Garry Tan.

Given life is a series of acts, envision a role, and play it to the best of your abilities ie visionary, sales, engineer etc. Itâ€™s all performances.

Authenticity wins. Playing a great bit requires 100% commitment and others will respect a great performance, especially the close few that know your authentic self.

The best advice: what would X do here? Where X is the best role player that comes to mind.

What role will you play today?

EDIT: Nov. 16, 2024 - [Impro](https://amzn.to/4fOsuXV) is a great book on status, playing games, and treating life as improv.
