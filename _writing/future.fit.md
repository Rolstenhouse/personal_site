# [Future.fit](http://Future.fit) review - celebrating 40 months

**Future** is a fitness app with someone who actually cares about your fitness goals. They want to see you win and have built an experience to make it possible.

And I have won. No injuries, better posture, vastly improved strength, and coordination.

I know what you’re thinking, I would have seen the same (or better results) if I spent time working out on my own. And you’re totally right, but I’m lazy and am more likely to exercise when someone else gives my programming.

## The nitty gritty of why it works

The app is deceptively good. Way better than any competitive product (and I’ve tried most) **Why?** It keeps me focused and in flow while exercising. When paired with the Apple Watch and Do Not Disturb, it’s 45 minutes of the day in a zen state.

Access to best in class, dynamic talent - my coach worked with professional athletes and is probably overqualified to give me directions. He always changes my programming whenever I have upcoming travel.

Fitness is on autopilot. I’m busy. You’re busy. I hate creating my gym programming and love having someone else (who knows my exact goals) do it for me.

## But it’s not perfect, or for everyone, and I have a couple of things I want them to fix

- Flow of exercises - occasionally the super set material requires a lot of distinct equipment, which can occasionally be a problem in a commercial gym. I worked with my trainer to craft this - but I wish I could send a video of equipment around me and have them build it off of that.
- Form checks - I wish I was prompted to provide a form video the first time I performed a new exercise. This is the largest downside of using an online training app vs an in-person trainer.
- Nailing the progressive weight changes - I’m not sure how bumps in strength are determined, but often feel some exercise are too easy and have to bump up the weights.
- Adding nutrition coaching - to make sure I’m maximizing protein intake while on a strength-building cycle.

## Overall

I signed up for future in September of 2020 and haven’t looked back since.
