title: Discovering hidden information & reps

Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is madness.

At least, that’s what doing the same rep over and over can feel like, but reps are different.

When you put in the reps, one of two things will happen. 1. The reps compound and suddenly you’re stronger and more prepared 2. Luck strikes sooner rather than later

Gathering information often requires putting in the reps. Asking the same thing over and over, occasionally learning the same thing, but more regularly discovering something new and refining your understanding on what’s possible.

There are a few ways to increase your likelihood of an asymmetric outcome, a large one by discovering hidden information and possibilities. Ask the right questions, even if you think it’ll be no.

Examples I personally used last weekend

- Tour booked out, messaged the host if they had extra space. They opened up 2 slots
- Asking for a lower rate at the mechanic. Yes, saved $100
- “Cash only” - They also accepted Zelle, no need to go to an ATM

These are weak. The world is more flexible than you think, ask and put in the reps asking.
