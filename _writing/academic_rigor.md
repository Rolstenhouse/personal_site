To pass a math or any other component based test, you must understand a topic. Understanding can be marked by the ability to teach someone else.

Understanding and academic rigor doesnâ€™t come for free. It takes active effort, memorization, and practice.

Remember how hard it was to dedicate and learn something when you were younger. Channel that energy into everything you do going forward.

Academia often misplaces that energy, but if you treat business, or any curiosity, with the same relentless drive to finish. Things will work out fine.
